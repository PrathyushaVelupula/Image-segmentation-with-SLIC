# Image-segmentation-with-SLIC

SLIC, Simple Linear Iterative Clustering, is a modification of the k-means algorithm. It helps with generating superpixels that
are approximately equal in size.

You are given a color picture. Process it using the SLIC pixel algorithm to create superpixels. Experiment with different
parameters of the createSuperpixelSLIC function to compute the superpixels.
